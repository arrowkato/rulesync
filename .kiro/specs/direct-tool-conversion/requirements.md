# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a direct conversion capability to rulesync that allows users to convert AI tool configurations from one format to another without requiring the intermediate `.rulesync/*.md` format. This enables quick migrations and tool switching for developers who want to move their existing configurations between different AI development assistants.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to convert my existing AI tool configuration directly to another tool's format, so that I can quickly switch between AI development assistants without manual reconfiguration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `rulesync convert --from cursor --to copilot` THEN the system SHALL parse Cursor configuration files and generate GitHub Copilot configuration files
2. WHEN I specify a source tool with `--from` THEN the system SHALL validate that the tool is supported for conversion
3. WHEN I specify target tools with `--to` THEN the system SHALL validate that all target tools are supported for conversion
4. WHEN the conversion is successful THEN the system SHALL output the generated configuration files to the appropriate directories
5. WHEN the source configuration files don't exist THEN the system SHALL display an error message indicating no source files found

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to convert to multiple target tools simultaneously, so that I can set up configurations for multiple AI assistants at once.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `rulesync convert --from cursor --to copilot,claudecode` THEN the system SHALL generate configurations for both GitHub Copilot and Claude Code
2. WHEN I specify multiple targets separated by commas THEN the system SHALL parse each target tool correctly
3. WHEN one target tool fails during conversion THEN the system SHALL continue processing other target tools and report the failure
4. WHEN all conversions complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of successful and failed conversions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear feedback about the conversion process, so that I can understand what was converted and identify any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the conversion starts THEN the system SHALL display which source tool is being parsed
2. WHEN generating each target configuration THEN the system SHALL display progress for each target tool
3. WHEN the conversion completes THEN the system SHALL display a summary of files created or updated
4. WHEN errors occur during conversion THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with context
5. WHEN source files are missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on what's needed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the conversion to preserve the semantic meaning of my rules, so that the behavior remains consistent across different AI tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting rule content THEN the system SHALL maintain the intent and meaning of the original rules
2. WHEN target tool format differs from source THEN the system SHALL adapt the content appropriately while preserving semantics
3. WHEN certain features are not supported in the target tool THEN the system SHALL provide warnings about unsupported features
4. WHEN conversion results in data loss THEN the system SHALL warn the user about what information cannot be preserved

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate that the conversion will work before executing it, so that I can avoid partial or failed conversions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify an unsupported source tool THEN the system SHALL display available source tools and exit with error
2. WHEN I specify an unsupported target tool THEN the system SHALL display available target tools and exit with error
3. WHEN the source tool has no configuration files THEN the system SHALL display helpful guidance about expected file locations
4. WHEN target directories are not writable THEN the system SHALL display permission errors before attempting conversion
